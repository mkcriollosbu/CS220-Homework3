For TAs:
I used the video posted on Piazza to follow the commands using the make file provided by the professor, 
I was unsure if we needed to adjusted the make file, so for now I left it as is. Problem is when I run 
"make", no build folder is constucted as well as when I run "make test" its just creating the o files, as
instucted by the make file. Please let me know if this is okay for this homework or what I should do, thank you.
